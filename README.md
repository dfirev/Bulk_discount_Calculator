# Bulk_discount_Calculator
This repository contains JavaScript code that calculates a bulk discount on the total cost of orders. 
A discount is applied when the quantity exceeds a defined threshold.
The same logic is implemented using three different types of functions: arrow function, function expression, and regular function declaration. 
This showcases different ways to write functions in JavaScript while achieving the same result.
